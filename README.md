# multitrim

This is the development script for the new MiGA trimming approach.

To use the script, create a conda environment using multitrim.yml. The command to create the environment is:

conda env create -f multitrim.yml.

This will create a conda environment with the correct tools and will allow you to run the multitrim python script.

On PACE, you will likely need to explicitly link to the binaries; I have prepared these for you
